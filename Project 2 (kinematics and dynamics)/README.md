In this Project, SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm) robot is examined. The focus is on the IRB 910SC model, which typically features four degrees of freedom (DOF). Furthermore, one of the rotatioal joints of SCARA robotis replaced with a prismatic joint. 

It then presents the kinematic and kinetostatic model, covering DH parameters, forward and inverse kinematics, and the Jacobian matrix. 

Dynamic modeling is performed using Lagrange equations, and the dynamic model is verified using the Simscape environment.
